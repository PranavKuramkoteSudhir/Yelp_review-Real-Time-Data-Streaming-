Real-time sentiment analysis of user comments using ChatGPT in a Streamlit app. 
Live updates from Kafka are displayed in a table with sentiment analysis results. Original data, sentiment, and other details are stored in PostgreSQL. 
Optimized for efficiency and integration.


This project involves real-time sentiment analysis of user comments using ChatGPT in a Streamlit application. Live updates are obtained from a Kafka topic ('order_detail'), displaying information such as review ID, user ID, business ID, stars, and category in a tabular format. The sentiment of user comments is analyzed using the ChatGPT model, and the results are integrated into the Streamlit UI. Additionally, the app connects to a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage, storing original user comments, sentiment analysis results, and other details. The project aims for efficiency in handling real-time data updates and seamless integration between Kafka, ChatGPT, Streamlit, and PostgreSQL.
