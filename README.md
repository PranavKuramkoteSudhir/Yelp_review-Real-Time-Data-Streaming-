-Yelp review data, including review ID, user ID, text, rating, and date, is initially collected.
-This data is streamed into a Kafka topic named reviews_db using a Kafka producer.
-Another component conducts sentiment analysis using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model on the data from reviews_db.
-GPT-3.5 Turbo generates sentiment ratings for each review, assessing the sentiment expressed in the text.
-The sentiment analysis results, along with the original review data, are sent to a separate Kafka topic named sentiment_analysis.
-A Kafka consumer retrieves messages from both reviews_db and sentiment_analysis.
-The consumer processes the messages, extracting review data and sentiment analysis results.
-Extracted review data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, maintaining data integrity and consistency.
-Tables such as reviews and sentiments in the PostgreSQL database capture the review details and sentiment analysis results.
-Tableau visualizations connected to the database provide insights into sentiment trends, distribution across categories, and user ratings.
